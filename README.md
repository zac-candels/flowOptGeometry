In this directory we're going to test the geometry setup for the flow optimization project. We will have several sub-directories -

1) In the directory 'capillaryFilling' we will have the constraining plate extend across the whole channel, but not the liquid. We expect to see 
   the liquid spontaneously fill the capillary 

2) In the directory 'smallConstrainingPlate', we test the geometry with ratchets, but reduce the extent (in the x-direction) of the constraining plate.
